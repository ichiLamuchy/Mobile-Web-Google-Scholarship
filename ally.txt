tab order
https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#sequential-focus-navigation-and-the-tabindex-attribute
    Be careful with CSS
        Form tag can be used key board based on the posion on the DOM
        So even using css to float: right; on the first item which visually shows the last visually on brower
        1st tab will be associate with the first DOM element.
        https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.2

    tabindex atribute
        can be used as tabindex = "0"
        negative number like -1 not in the natural tab order
        can be programatically focused with focus()method
            document.querySelecter("#model").focus()
    "0"
        is in the natural tab order
        and can be programmatically focused
    "5"
        is in the natural tab order
        jumped to the front of the tab order
        anti-pattern
        confusing to screen reader

    ++tab is for something user will be interactive
    
    managing focus
    
        things like menu items on single page website where it takes you to the
        right part of the page when you clicked, you can add taborder = "-1" no it doesn't appear on the natural taborder
        but call its focus method after the user has taken their action
