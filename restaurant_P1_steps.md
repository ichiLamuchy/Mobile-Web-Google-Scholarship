## STEPS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT

Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000  

### 1: Get your own Google Maps API key. Replace the text YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY 
    on line 37 of index.html with your own key. then check if it works

### 2: Convert the provided site to use a responsive design.
 
    No Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks, all responsiveness should be done with CSS.

            Note: (double check if it is ok)
                Set at least font-size:18 px line height: 1.25em
                65 cpl for web
                48dp minimum touch 
                32 pixel apart put margin around

    
    2-1: Make all width to 100 %
        get rid of the style change the display such as 
        display: fixed / absolute
    
        As we may use it later on, keep the original style sheet (as a different name)
    
    2-2: Where possible change font size to em or rpm

### 3: Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    

### 4: Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp
    https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flex-direction
    
    ---------------
    restaurant.html
    ----------------
    example one:
    
    display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
	-webkit-flex-direction: row-reverse; /* Safari 6.1+ */
    
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row-reverse; 
    
    ----------
    index.html
    ----------
    This kind of things can be used on index.html, see how it look
    @media (min-width:500px)  { 
    .filter-options {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
        .filter-options select {
        display: flex;
        flex-grow: 1;
    }
    }
    
    
### 5: Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
    Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
    
    5-1: consider container size
    ---------------
    restaurant.html
    ----------------
    once it gone bigger:
    you can use flex-direction: row-reverse; 
    or introduce back the display:absolute or fixed on map and right:0
    
    -------------
    index.html
    -------------
    see section 4
    
    5-2: consider fontsize
    
    +++++    here make sure all work as expected compare to what udacity present ++++++++++++++++


### 6: Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).

    6-1 keep in mind sementics (Name (Label), Role, Value: mark up is used in a way that facilitates accessibility)
    
    
    6-2 check tab - ( at nav or any other plave like h) and add tabindex if necessary
    
    
    6-3 For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles need to be defined.
        
        
    6-3 check image has alt attribute
    https://github.com/ichiLamuchy/Mobile-Web-Google-Scholarship/blob/master/ally.txt
    
        area-role or alt on image by using js

    +++++ check all style and rubic ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    
    
### 7: Once all dobne 

    Now, add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that 
    any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. 
    Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
