======================
Responsive image

======================


Check the image
Size of the image check(compressed)
go to network and disable cache then reload, you can see if the size difference

Natural size check
go to element, click one of image you wannacheck
then click console and type $0 to see what it is
type $0.naturalWidth to check natural width
you could also just click the image on the element



Total bits = pixels x bits per pixel
Less pixel x better compressionn = less bytes

how do you have less size while maintain quority

if you fix max-width to image, it;s only goes up till natural image but good to use

if you wanna put image side by side

You can put margin between the images 
suchu as 
  margin-right: 10px;
  width:calc((100% - 10px)/2);

just type selecter to not put marginaftern the last image
  img:last-of-type {
    margin:0 ; 
  }

vh - view port height
vw - view port width
width: 100vw;

vmin - view port minimum
fit to smaller hight or width of view port
If you set it to both, it will get the effect
  width: 100vmin;
  height: 100vmin;

vmax - viewport max
cover whole vieport without stretching or squosh.
it corresponding to whichever greater of vp
but it will chane img tp square 
  width: 100vmax;
  height: 100vmax;
  

Raster vs Vecter
Vecter is better, browser can render a vecter image at any size
SVG is so much smaller

use jpg for photograph
webp is widely supported - alpha transparency and animaton
if you cannot use svg then use png, 
use png over gif
  
Natural imagesize:
Obviously image need to be only as large as it's display
If network is slow, the img will take more time to load

Optimize images
    grunt-page speed

remember 1em is 16px
reasonable width is 50em
