        How to express semantics HTML cannot express
        Aria works by allowing you to specify attributes on elements
        which modify the way that element is translated into the accessibility tree

        ARIA 1.0 spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/
        ARIA 1.1 spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/

    Example, 
    role = "checkbox" aria-checked="true"
    aria attribute always need explicit value
     
    you can set 
        funtion Checkbox(el){
            this.elsetAttributs('role', 'checkbox');
            if (this.el.hasAttribute('checked')){
                this.el.setAttribute('aria-checked', 'true');           
            } else {
                this.el.setAttribute('area-checked', 'false');
            }
        }
        Checkbox.prototype.toggle = function (){
            if (this.el.hasAttribute('checked'))
                this.el.removeAttribute('checked');

                this.el.setAtribute('area-checked', 'false');
            }else {
                this.el.setAttribute('checked', '');
                this.el.setAttribute('area-checked', 'true');
            }
       }
     
    Roles -------------------------------
    
        you can modify the sementic meaning by using role
        <button role="switch"

        area can express sementic patterns do not exist in html even!
        such as role = "tree"  / role = "treeitem"

        ARIA allows us to create accessible widgets - not possible in plain html

        ARIA can add extra description text and label, 
        which is only exposed to assisted technology APIs.

        <role = "alart"> Attention!</div> 
            immidiately will voice over

      
        * important - role attribute set the same tag as tabindex attribute is in
        
        Aria spec - Taxonomy pof possible value

        Practice guide: gives you example of how to do
        https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/
        
        abstruct role means common to several role but may not used as value for the role attribute
        
        eample of JS
        useing setAttribute to set such as ('role', 'radiogroup') to each el
        removeAttribute and setAttribute to switch around
        
        adding labels
        
        aria-label
            <button aria-label="menu" class = "hamburger"> (some pic)</button>
            there is no text only visual indication
            in this case it would be 
                    button 
                    name:"menu"
            if the button has x mark with text. And the function is for close the window 
            you can set it as aria-label="close"
            
        aria-labelledby
            specify another id to any element
            <div role ="radiogroup" aria-labelledby = "id1">
            then tag where id="id1" has Drink Option then "Drink Option" become the name
                    radiogroup
                    name:"Drink Option" 
                    
            it is works similar to label element but the relation is oppositway around.
            <label> elemets refers to the thing it labels (<input>)
            labledeby refers to the things labels it
            
            aria-labelledby can take multiple elements 
            The label will be concatenated in the order of the ID refs are given
            It overrides all other name sources for an element.
                even if there are area-label or class attribute there, 
                aria-labelledby will always take precedence.
            
        aria-describedby
