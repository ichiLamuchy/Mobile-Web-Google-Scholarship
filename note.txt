=====================

Start Small
=====================

Set viewport
<meta name="viewport" content="with=device-width, initial-scale=1">

// initial-scale=1 means 1:1 
so it will keep as it is on CSS

CSS allow content to overflow it's container
(Such as img overflow the size of div)
To prevent this set 

img, embed, object, video{
  max-width: 100%;
}
