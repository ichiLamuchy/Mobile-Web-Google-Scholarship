Netcat
http://nc110.sourceforge.net/
(i.e) 

    nc google.com 80
    GET / HTTP/1.1 (then enter twice, first one is new line second is indicate finish)
    Then it will give you header
    bit like curl -I / curl --head 

    Method HTTP Verb
        Other than GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
        there are also HEAD, OPTION

    If you do 
    nc google.com 80
    HEAD / HTTP/1.1 

        You get the headers of a file with out receiving the entire file itself
        you can check such as Content-Length and Last-Modified to see 
        if the cached contents are still up to date

    nc google.com 80
    OPTION / HTTP/1.1 

        it gives a list of methods are accepted on the current URL, 
        but not every server supports this

    So when you are setting header you can write

        nc google.com 80
        GET / HTTP/1.1 
        Host: host.com
        Date: Wed, qq Jan 1995 23:00:00 GMT
        whatever-header: yes


TCP allows us to have multiple, independent streams of data
between 2 machines. Steams are distinguished by port numbers

HTTPS additional TLS hand shake


====================
HTTP 2

====================


TTFB time to first byte
head of line blocking (synchronous)

Browser being able to open up 6 parallel connections
helps but not so great.
HTTP 1.1 header -Connection: keep-alive

bundlesJS can put things all together to make it one request
