### project 2 steps

    Basic Steps to complete
    1: Fork and clone the server repository. 
    Youâ€™ll use this development server to develop your project code.

    2: Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, 
    parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.

    3: Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.

    4: Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve 
    the required performance targets.

    4: Submit your project code for review.

So two main things

  1: Change to Use server data instead of local memory 
  by use fetch API.
  2: Use IndexedDB to cache JSON responses
  3: accessability retained as it is
  4: check performance using lighthouse
